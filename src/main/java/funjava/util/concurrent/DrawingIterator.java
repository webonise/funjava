 * Provides an {@link java.util.Iterator} API for consuming a {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} being filled by

 * presumes that it is the only thing drawing from the queue.</li> <li>This class is NOT itself thread-safe.</li>
 * <li>The queue cannot contain {@code null} elements as meaningful values.</li> </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that this class's {@link #forEachRemaining(java.util.function.Consumer)} is much more efficient than the classic
 * {@link java.util.Iterator} loop.
